# EEG Signal Classification Project Overview

This project focuses on the classification of EEG signals, specifically for seizure detection. The tasks include feature extraction, model building, evaluation, and improving the performance using various machine learning techniques.

Task Breakdown
Tasks 4.1 to 5.1: These tasks are implemented as Notebooks. They cover the following:
Task 4.1: Feature Extraction from EEG Signals By Basic Analysis Of The Signals 
Task 5.1: Extracting Frequency Domain Features

Task 6 to 10: These tasks are implemented as Code. They involve:

Task 6: Building the Baseline Model using SVM.
Task 7: Optimizing the model and building the best model.
Task 8: Interpreting the best model with feature importance.
Task 9: Denoising EEG Data to improve the quality.
Task 10: Using Generative Modeling (cGAN) for generating synthetic EEG data.
The code for these tasks has been implemented and executed, and their respective outputs have been captured as images and analysis reports.

# Outputs
# Images: Key results, such as model evaluation metrics, ROC curves, and feature importance graphs, are presented as images for better visualization.

# Analysis Reports: Detailed analysis reports for each task are included to summarize the findings and evaluation metrics.

# Conclusion
This project combines data preprocessing, model building, and various enhancements to build an effective EEG signal classification system. The task breakdown ensures each step is carefully executed, from feature extraction to model interpretation, and finally, the application of generative models to augment the data.
