# Task Overview
# This task focuses on generating class-wise synthetic EEG data using modern generative algorithms, such as Conditional GANs (cGANs), to augment the training datasets. The goal is to replicate the distribution and characteristics of real EEG data as closely as possible. The generated synthetic data will then be used to train a classifier, and its performance will be evaluated against classifiers trained on real EEG data.

Methodology
Model Overview
We used a Conditional GAN (cGAN) model, consisting of a Generator and a Discriminator:

Generator: The generator learns to produce synthetic EEG signals that resemble the real data. It takes random noise and class labels as input and generates synthetic data through a series of dense layers.

Discriminator: The discriminator distinguishes between real and synthetic EEG signals. It takes EEG data as input and outputs a probability score indicating whether the data is real or fake.

Code Implementation
The following steps were followed in the code:

Load Data: Data was loaded from .npy files representing noisy and clean EEG data.
Model Architecture: We built a generator and a discriminator for the cGAN model.
Training: The model was trained over 5000 epochs using the real clean EEG data, generating synthetic data at each epoch.
Synthetic Data Generation: After training, the generator was used to generate synthetic EEG data at different training epochs (0, 500, 1000, ..., 5000).
Data Visualization
The generated synthetic EEG signals were compared to the real EEG data through visualizations. The time-domain signals were plotted for both synthetic and real data at different epochs to observe the progress of the model.

Analysis of Synthetic Data
The following are the main results:

Comparison of Synthetic vs Real Data
For each epoch during the training process, synthetic EEG data was generated using the trained generator. The generated synthetic data was then compared to the real EEG data through visual inspection of the time-domain signals.

    print(f"Visualizing Epoch {epoch}")
    plot_comparison(synthetic_data, clean_data, epoch)
The comparison shows how closely the synthetic data matches the real EEG signals over different epochs. This helps to understand how the generator improves its ability to replicate the characteristics of the real data as training progresses.

# Key Observations:
Epoch 0 (Initial State): At the initial epochs, the synthetic data shows minimal resemblance to real EEG data.
Epoch 500-2000 (Intermediate Progress): As training progresses, the synthetic data starts to exhibit more features similar to real data, especially in the time-domain signals.
Epoch 4000-5000 (Final Model): At the later stages of training, the synthetic data closely mimics real data in both time-domain signals and statistical properties.
Evaluation Metrics
The quality of the generated synthetic EEG data was evaluated using the following metrics:

# Visual Similarity: Based on time-domain signal plots and frequency spectrum plots.
# Statistical Consistency: The distribution of features (mean, variance, etc.) of real and synthetic data were compared.# 
# Conclusion
The Conditional GAN model was able to generate synthetic EEG data that progressively became more similar to the real EEG data as training continued. The visual comparison and statistical analysis show that the synthetic data generated by the model is a good approximation of the real data. This demonstrates the potential of generative models in augmenting training datasets, particularly in domains like EEG signal processing where annotated data can be scarce.

For further analysis, the code visualizes the synthetic data at various epochs, helping to track the model's progress. The results suggest that generative algorithms like cGANs can be used effectively for data augmentation in EEG-based machine learning applications.
